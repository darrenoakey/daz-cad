# DAZ-CAD-2

A browser-based parametric CAD editor with 3D text support and multi-material 3MF export for Bambu Lab printers.

## Purpose

DAZ-CAD-2 is a web-based CAD application that allows you to create and edit 3D models directly in your browser. It features:

- Parametric modeling with numeric variable sliders
- 3D text creation
- Multi-material support with automatic filament assignment
- Export to Bambu Lab-compatible 3MF files for direct printing
- Global opacity controls for visualization

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd daz-cad-2

# Install dependencies
./run install
```

This installs Python dependencies, development tools, and the Playwright browser for testing.

## Usage

### Starting the Server

```bash
./run serve
```

The server starts at `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. Open this URL in your browser to access the CAD editor.

### Running Tests

Run a specific test:

```bash
./run test src/server_test.py::test_health
```

Run the full test suite:

```bash
./run check
```

### Linting

```bash
./run lint
```

### Building Custom OpenCascade (Optional)

If you need to rebuild the OpenCascade.js library with FreeType support:

```bash
./run build-opencascade
```

This requires Docker to be installed and running.

## Examples

### Creating a Simple Model

1. Start the server with `./run serve`
2. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765` in your browser
3. Use the editor interface to create shapes
4. Adjust parameters using the properties panel sliders
5. Export to 3MF for printing

### Multi-Material Export

The editor supports assigning different colors/materials to different parts of your model. When exporting to 3MF format, these assignments are preserved in a format compatible with Bambu Lab slicers (Bambu Studio, Orca Slicer), allowing automatic filament mapping to your AMS.

### Using Demo Files
